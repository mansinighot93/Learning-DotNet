Here are the answers to your questions:  

### **C# Concepts**  
#### **1. Static Class and Its Function**  
A **static class** in C# is a class that **cannot be instantiated** and **contains only static members**. It is used when you want to create utility/helper methods that do not depend on instance variables.  

- Declared using the `static` keyword.  
- Cannot have constructors or instance methods.  
- Example:  
  ```csharp
  public static class MathHelper
  {
      public static int Square(int num) => num * num;
  }
  ```
  Usage:  
  ```csharp
  int result = MathHelper.Square(5);
  ```

#### **2. Abstract Class**  
An **abstract class** in C# is a **base class that cannot be instantiated** and **can contain both abstract (unimplemented) and non-abstract (implemented) methods**. It is used when you want to provide a common base with some shared functionality.  

- Declared using the `abstract` keyword.  
- Must be inherited by derived classes.  
- Can have abstract methods (which must be implemented in child classes).  

Example:  
```csharp
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound();
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
    }
}
```

#### **3. Interface**  
An **interface** is a contract that defines **method signatures** but does not provide any implementation.  

- Declared using the `interface` keyword.  
- Can be implemented by multiple classes.  
- Example:  
  ```csharp
  interface IAnimal
  {
      void MakeSound();
  }

  class Dog : IAnimal
  {
      public void MakeSound()
      {
          Console.WriteLine("Bark!");
      }
  }
  ```

#### **4. Overriding vs Overloading**  
- **Overriding**: Redefining a method in a derived class using the `override` keyword.  
  ```csharp
  class Parent
  {
      public virtual void Show() { Console.WriteLine("Parent Show"); }
  }

  class Child : Parent
  {
      public override void Show() { Console.WriteLine("Child Show"); }
  }
  ```

- **Overloading**: Having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.  
  ```csharp
  class Calculator
  {
      public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
      public double Add(double a, double b) => a + b;
  }
  ```

### **Project Related Questions**  
#### **1. Find the Number of Occurrences of Each Character in a Given String**  
```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string input = "hello world";
        var characterCount = input.GroupBy(c => c)
                                  .ToDictionary(c => c.Key, c => c.Count());

        foreach (var item in characterCount)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{item.Key}: {item.Value}");
        }
    }
}
```

#### **2. Find the Maximum Salary of Employees in Each Department**  
```csharp
SELECT DepartmentID, MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```

#### **3. Self Introduction**  
You can introduce yourself by mentioning:  
- Your name  
- Your experience and skills  
- Technologies you work with  
- Projects you have worked on  
- Future goals  

Example:  
*"Hi, I am [Your Name]. I have experience in C#, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server. I have worked on various projects involving CRUD operations, session management, and API development. My goal is to enhance my skills in software architecture and cloud computing."*

#### **4. Update Query for Gender Column**  
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Gender = CASE 
    WHEN Gender = 'Male' THEN 'Female'
    WHEN Gender = 'Female' THEN 'Male'
    ELSE Gender
END;
```

#### **5. Inheritance Question (User & Employee)**  
- `Employee e = new User();` → ❌ **False** (Parent cannot be assigned to child).  
- `User u = new Employee();` → ✅ **True** (Child can be assigned to parent due to polymorphism).

### **Session & State Management**  
#### **1. What is Session Management?**  
Session management is used to store user-specific data across multiple requests in a web application.  
- Example: **Session variables in ASP.NET MVC**  
  ```csharp
  Session["UserName"] = "John";
  string user = Session["UserName"].ToString();
  ```

#### **2. What is State Management?**  
State management refers to maintaining the state of user data across multiple requests.  
- **Client-Side**: Cookies, Local Storage, Query Strings  
- **Server-Side**: Sessions, Application State, Database Storage

### **General Programming Concepts**  
#### **1. Find Maximum Value in an Array**  
```csharp
int[] arr = { 10, 20, 5, 50, 40 };
int maxVal = arr.Max();
Console.WriteLine(maxVal);
```

#### **2. Access Modifiers**  
- **public** → Accessible everywhere  
- **private** → Accessible only within the same class  
- **protected** → Accessible within the same class and derived classes  
- **internal** → Accessible within the same assembly  

#### **3. Stored Procedure**  
A **stored procedure** is a SQL script stored in the database.  
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployees
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employees;
END;
```
Execution:  
```sql
EXEC GetEmployees;
```

#### **4. Primary Key vs Foreign Key**  
- **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for a table (e.g., EmployeeID).  
- **Foreign Key**: Links one table to another (e.g., DepartmentID in Employees table references Department table).

### **AJAX in MVC**  
#### **1. What is AJAX?**  
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows updating a part of a web page without refreshing the whole page.  
#### **2. AJAX Function in jQuery**  
```javascript
$.ajax({
    url: "/Home/GetData",
    type: "GET",
    success: function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

### **C# Advanced Topics**  
#### **1. `ref` and `out` Keyword**  
- `ref` → Passes a variable by reference; must be initialized before passing.  
- `out` → Passes a variable by reference; does not need to be initialized before passing.  

```csharp
void SampleMethod(ref int a, out int b)
{
    a += 10;
    b = 20; // Mandatory for `out`
}
```

#### **2. ADO.NET Components**  
- **DataReader** → Reads data in a forward-only stream.  
- **DataSet** → In-memory representation of a database.  
- **DataTable** → Represents a table.  
- **DataRow** → Represents a row in a DataTable.

### **MVC, Middleware, and Dependency Injection**  
#### **1. What is MVC?**  
- **Model** → Data and business logic  
- **View** → UI layer  
- **Controller** → Handles user requests  

#### **2. What is Middleware?**  
Middleware is software that processes requests before they reach the MVC controller.  

Example:  
```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Middleware executing...");
    await next();
});
```

#### **3. What is Dependency Injection?**  
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to inject dependencies into a class instead of creating them inside the class.  

Example:  
```csharp
services.AddScoped<IEmployeeService, EmployeeService>();
```
